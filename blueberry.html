					<p>Ingredients
						3 pound blueberries
						2 pounds granulated sugar
						1 cup lemon juice
						1 cinnamon stick
							Start by bringing a boiling-water canner, 3/4 full with water, to simmer. Wash jars and screw bands in hot soapy water; rinse with warm water. Pour boiling water over flat lids in saucepan off the heat. Let stand in hot water until ready to use. Drain well before filling.
							Combine the blueberries, sugar, cinnamon stick and lemon juice in a 5-quart nonreactive pan. Cover and bring to a boil then reduce the heat a fast simmer and cook uncovered, for 10-15 minutes stirring frequently.
							Test to see if it has “set” by spooning a bit onto a cold plate.  If it has formed a bit of a skin and started to give a bit like goopy jell-o, you’re good to go, if not, cook for a bit longer.
							When jam is ready, remove the cinnamon stick and ladle immediately into prepared jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of tops. Wipe jar rims and threads. Cover with two-piece lids. Screw bands on. Place jars on elevated rack in a canner. Lower rack into canner.  Water must cover jars by 1 to 2 inches. Add boiling water, if necessary.
							Cover and bring water to gentle boil. Process 10 min. Remove jars and place upright on towel to cool completely. After the jars have cooled, check the seals by pressing middles of lids with finger. If lids spring back, lids are not sealed and refrigeration is necessary. 
						Yields about 8 1/2 pints.</p>
